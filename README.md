# jWARE: Ransomware base in Java
##Description
jWARE is one of the very few "ransomware" bases available that were created in Java. Uses only default libraries to achieve file encryption and requires no special privileges (such as administrator). This project was developed by Bill Demirkapi and is available under the MIT License.
##Features
* Command & Control Server
* Online decryption made easy (manager.php)
* Encrypts all writable files starting in the user directory, requiring no special permissions
* Compatible with every operating system that supports default Java libraries
* Documented code
##Why?
This project was meant to be more educational than harmful, such as being used for malicious intent. Some features such as payment checking or automatic popups were not added in order to deter the project to be used as malware. I hope that through this project, people will be able to understand the true power of Java.
